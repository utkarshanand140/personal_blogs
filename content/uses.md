The idea of a Uses page is to tell you about the stuff I use.

Make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) for a list of everyone's Uses pages!

I often get asked about what software or hardware I use, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious readers to when I get asked.

## Editor + Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my current editor
- Brave is my main browser
- iTerm2 is my terminal

## Softwares for Robotics
- KiCAD for designing PCBs.
- PlatformIO Extension on VS Code for programming general microcontrollers and STM32CUBE IDE for working with STM based microcontrollers.
- SEGGER SysView for analyzing when I work with Real-Time-Operating-Systems.
- MATLAB & Simulink for all mathetmatical related work.
- ROS2 + Gazebo for software programming work on robots.
